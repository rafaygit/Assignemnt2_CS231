The user inputs the initial values (Column-wise array) including a 0. The data gets stored in a 2d array. The program tests array  indexes to the goal state array indexes by BFS implementation. The initial state, goal state and steps are shown on command-line. The program finally shows the total number of steps when the goal state is reached.

There are some bugs in the program that still need to be tested out and optimized. For example, for some initial states it takes an infinite amount of time to solve them.
